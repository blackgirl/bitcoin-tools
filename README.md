Bitcoin tools
=============

A variety of Bitcoin tools.

A powerful API that can be used to build front-end apps.

- /latest_sells_bcid returns the latest asking prices for buying BTC on bitcoin.co.id
- /latest_global_average returns the latest global BTC average value
- /exchanges return a list of exchanges around the world and what they will buy BTC for

The combination of the above 3 calls can be used to build an arbitrage app for BTC. An example of one is [here](http://bitcoin.golightlyplus.com/).

More info on arbitrage
----------------------

Buyers place bids and sellers place asking prices.

So buying from bitcoin.co.id we look at the asking prices (or sell prices), and then selling them to other exchanges we look at the bid or buy price.
