Bitcoin tools
=============

A variety of Bitcoin tools.

A powerful API that can be used to build front-end apps.

- /latest_sells_bcid returns the latest asking prices for buying BTC on bitcoin.co.id
- /latest_global_average returns the latest global BTC average value
- /exchanges return a list of exchanges around the world and what they will buy BTC for

The combination of the above 3 calls can be used to build an arbitrage app for BTC. An example of one is [here](http://bitcoin.golightlyplus.com/).
